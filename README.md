Hi. This is the begining of my journey witch the language C. I want to create programs for public use and as a base of a bigger project of mine. 

This one is a name sorting program, that reads from a file than the sorted names appear in the console window.

USAGE: For the input you have to specify a path for the file with the random names in. It wasn't tested on input with accent so be prepared that it might not work with that.
If you correctly specified the path for a .txt file it will read from it, sort the names into a list and than outputs the names in the console window.
//It was tested on windows with around 600 names at one, without any unicode character.
